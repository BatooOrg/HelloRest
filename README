 11) Open a command prompt and cd into C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\Github\HelloRest. Run "mvn -Dmaven.test.skip install".
 
 12) run "copy target\HelloRest.war C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\apache-tomcat-7.0.32\webapps\"
 
 13) cd into C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\apache-tomcat-7.0.32. Run "bin\catalina.bat run"
 
 14) Run Jmeter on desktop. Open test file at C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\Github\HelloRest\test.jmx. Run the test, navigate to Report and note the Throughput.
 
 15) Go to  C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\Github\HelloRest, Edit the file src/main/java/org/batoo/jpa/hellorest/ApplicationConfig.java and change BATOO_OR_HIBERNATE field to false.
